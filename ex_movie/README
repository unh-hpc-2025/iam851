This somewhat contrived example simulates (somewhat) the steps that
may be necessary to turn simulation results into a movie.

There are three steps:

- "python lim1.py" runs the "simulation". It creates datafiles
  "data_<i>.npy", where i goes from 0 to 119 as time proceeds

- "python plot.py <input.npy> <output.png>" plots the datafile
  <input.npy>.  The resulting plot is an image, saved as <output.png>

- "ffmpeg -y -i data_%d.png -r 5 lim1.mp4" reads those image files and
  turns them into the movie lim1.mp4

The script "make_movie.sh" performs all the steps automatically, though
it's a bit dumb about it in that it always starts from scratch.
